This is a small python project that involves web scraping Nykaa's jewellery section to extract product information, such as title, prices and reviews. The scraped data provides insights into latest jewellery collection available on Nykaa's website.
Here, I've used Python libraries like Beautiful Soup, Requests, Pandas.
